Importing data from Excel into RStudio
======================================
1. Save your spreadsheet as a .csv (comma separated values) file with "Save As"
2. Save to a folder in your network file share, e.g. "nfs/khondula-data/coolProject/coolData.csv"
	+ see research support page on mapping/accessing the network file share
	+ different for Linux, Mac, Windows Operating systems
3. In RStudio, use a function like read.csv() to import your data into a dataframe
	+ read.csv() will print your data in the console
	+ use the arrow notation to give that data frame a name and make it an object

{% highlight R %} 
mydata <- read.csv(file="/nfs/public-data/Ed/HW1_data.csv")
{% endhighlight %}
